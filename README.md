# Work in progress!

I am updating my CV to not use `moderncv` class, because it's not easily customizable.

## How to compile:

Your should probably install full version of `texlive` package.
It is couple of GB, but you get everything LaTeX has to offer.

On Debian package is called `texlive-full`.

**If you don't want to use install LaTeX on your computer you can use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).**
