# About this project:

This CV uses amazing [AltaCV](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV) class.

You can see the latest version of my CV at [this link](https://matejamaric.com/cv.pdf).

## How to compile:

Just run `pdflatex cv.tex`.

Your should probably install full version of `texlive` package.
It is couple of GB, but you get everything LaTeX has to offer.

On Debian package is called `texlive-full`.

**If you don't want to use install LaTeX on your computer you can use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).**
