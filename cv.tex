\section{Experience}
\subsection{Web Development}
\cventry{}{Serbian YOTA Website}{}{}{\url{https://yota.yu1srs.org.rs}}{
Website I made for Serbian section of international youth amateur radio organization ``Youngsters On The Air'' (\url{https://www.ham-yota.com/}). 
Made primarily to handle frequency reservations and special call signs management, 
but it also has simple news and gallery management.
It's made with the help of Laravel, MariaDB, jQuery and Bootstrap. 
You can take a look at source code on: \url{https://git.matejamaric.com/yota-laravel}
}

\subsection{GNU/Linux Administration}
\cventry{}{Mail Server}{}{}{}{
I host my very own mail server that serves my domain. It runs OpenSMTPD, Dovecot and Rspamd.
I host it on an unmanaged Virtual Private Server with full root and VNC access, where I configured everything from ground up.
It is the project I am most proud of, given all the technicalities that go into it and time I had to allocate for them.
I plan on switching to Postfix instead of OpenSMTPD and adding MariaDB to manage virtual users and domains, effectively making it enterprise-grade.
}

\cventry{}{Git Server}{}{}{\url{https://git.matejamaric.com}}{
I have a git server that I use for my public and private repositories. It runs Gitolite and serves public repositories with Cgit, 
git-http-backend and Apache.\\
I also have a blog post about it: \url{https://matejamaric.com/blog/git-server/}
}

\subsection{3D Graphics Programming}
\cventry{}{3D Software Render}{}{}{\url{https://github.com/MatejaMaric/erender}}{
Barycentric 3D render that I made back when I was interested in computer graphics. 
It's written entirely from scratch in C++ using SFML library for screen buffer, making it cross-platform.
It implements OBJ loader, Z-buffering, translation, transformation, rotation and projection matrix.
